## Questions
1) What search strategies did you use?
- started by searching for the poem titles in HathiTrust
- Advanced Search: Author and Title of the Magazine, filter by Year after, then looked in the Hennessey dataset to find the magazine it was published in
- Searched for poem title in magazine
- **How we figured it out: USE THE Quotes from the Poem with “”**
2) Were you able to find all the issues you looked for?
- Yes, we were.
3) What barriers or challenges did you encounter?
- Searching for the poem titles didn’t surface relevant/accurate results
- Poems were inside magazines, advanced search by title and author did not give us results we needed

**Examining OCR Quality**

4) Can you search for specific words or phrases within the document?
- For **Prayer Bells**, we were able to search for words and find them within the document pretty seamlessly, except for text that was too small to be read and too small to be searched.
- For **June** and **A Song to the Flowers**, the issue was digitized pretty well, and we were able to search for specific words/phrases.
5) How accurate is the OCR text compared to what you see in the page images?
- From preliminary searching, it seems that **Prayer Bells’** text tended to be small and unreadable as well as the margins being lop-sided
- **June’s** scan was high-quality and OCR was able to read it perfectly.
- **A Song to the Flowers’** OCR text is accurate to what is visible in the page images
6) What kinds of errors do you notice? (Consider fonts, layouts, damaged pages, etc.)
- For **Prayer-Bells** (The Colored American magazine) and **A Song to the Flowers**: The page margins aren’t consistent from page to page.
- For **June**, the page margins are consistent, but some pages of the issue were too washed out and damaged, making it hard for the reader or an OCR software
7) How might OCR quality affect research using this material?
- Better OCR quality leads to a more seamless search for material, if you can’t tell what you are reading, and if the computer is unable to recognize the text within the document and match it to your search then it makes the research process much more difficult.

**Understanding Context**

8) What additional context do you gain from seeing the original page?
- We get to see the FULL poem; the dataset only has excerpts of them.
9) What else appears on the page or in the issue alongside the poem?
- Before the poem **Prayer Bells** there is a short article about and uplifting famous Black men of the time. After the poem, there was what seems to be a chapter of a novel from another site.
- In **June**, there’s another poem on top of it, called “June Lyrics”, and a header showing the issue, date, and volume.
10) What information was lost in creating just the dataset of poems?
- Visual layout of the page (font size, spacing, column structure)
- Surrounding content such as ads
- Material texture
11) What information was gained by creating the structured dataset?
- Standardized and more searchable

## Group Theme: Food as Cultural Artifacts 🍽️
## Discovering and Digitizing Cultural Objects

<details>
<summary><strong><b>Soham Solanki</b></strong> — Digital Representation</summary>
Some digital objects/representations that would be valuable for studying food as cultural artifacts are:

- TikTok recipe videos (with full metadata): the video itself, with captions, hashtags, likes, comments, and engagement metrics would capture not just the food but the performance, cultural framing, and community response.
- “Food Discourse” tweet threads: there are many debates surrounding the authenticity of different foods (e.g. “Is this authentic pad thai?” or “You can’t call that jollof rice.”). These threads can talk about cultural ownership and authority in real-time
- Food prep content: videos where food preparation is hand-in-hand with lifestyle performance (e.g. “get ready with me” or “easy 5-ingredient recipes if you’re in a rush”), showing how food signals discipline, morality, or identity.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><b>Diara Shah</b></strong> — Digitization Process</summary>
Some of the main ways food becomes digitized as a cultural artifact are:

- **Born-digital food content:**  
  Most food content now a days is created digitally from the start, usually on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and food blogs posted online. Recipes are shared as videos, photos, or posts, with captions, hashtags and also likes and comments.

- **Platform metadata instead of library metadata:**  
  Food content is organized mainly using hashtags, sounds, and algorithms rather than formal library systems. Hashtags like #lazyrecipes, #tofusaladrecipe, and specific things like that can be used across social medias or on search engines. This is different from HathiTrust, which uses structured catalog records and OCR.

- **Digitizing older food materials:**  
  Historical food items such as cookbooks, menus, and food magazines are digitized by scanning physical pages and using OCR, similar to what we observed in HathiTrust. However, OCR often struggles with decorative fonts, handwritten notes, or stained pages which are pretty coomon in food-related materials to make it more aesthetically pleasing.

- **Changing and unstable digital objects:**  
  Unlike scanned materials in HathiTrust, digital food content can be edited, deleted, or remixed over time, making it harder to preserve as a just a stable object object.

<summary><strong><b>Flynn Huynh</b></strong> — Historical Equivalents</summary>

### Historical Equivalents

*Kahle repeatedly referenced the Library of Alexandria as the ancient world's attempt to collect all knowledge, which was ultimately lost to fire. Our digital food archives face similar preservation challenges, even as they make culinary knowledge far more accessible than their physical predecessors.*

---

#### Example 1: Handwritten Recipe Cards -> Digital Recipe Blogs

**Historical Object: Mid-20th Century Recipe Card Box**

<img src="https://i.redd.it/xd0j9azfukz61.jpg" width="500" height="250"> <br>
*Image: (Reddit) recipes card from 1930s-1950s. : r/Old_Recipes*

**Modern Equivalent: Online Recipe Blogs/Libraries**

<img src="https://cdn.tasteatlas.com/images/cdn/recipe-share.png?m=facebook" width="500" height="250"> <br>
*Image: (TasteAtlas) Online Recipe Blog*

**Comparison:**

**What's lost in digitization:**
- **Handwriting as identity:** The chef's handwriting carried meaning and care in writing it down
- **Materiality:** Stained index cards showed which recipes were cooked most often
- **Physical context:** Recipe boxes lived in kitchens, were tactile objects tied to specific places and people
- **Intimacy:** Recipe cards were personal, often shared one-to-one (friend to friend, mother to daughter)
- **Uniqueness:** Many handwritten recipes existed in only one copy—their loss was permanent

**What's gained in digitization:**
- **Photos/video:** Modern blogs show what the dish should look like at each step (impossible with handwritten cards)
- **Permanence of sharing:** A blog post reaches millions and can be archived; a recipe card could be lost or hoarded
- **Searchability:** Can find " recipe" instantly; physical recipe boxes required manual sorting
- **Updates:** Digital recipes can be edited/improved; handwritten cards were fixed
- **Accessibility features:** Digital recipes can be scaled (2x, 3x servings), translated, read aloud

#### Example 2: Physical Restaurant Menus -> Digital Menu

**Historical Object: 1900s Restaurant Menu**

<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT3d_dJOO1geVr8vvWCPEP0HmAdpMPd4OA-HQ&s" width="250" height="500"> <br>
*Image: (The New York Public Library) Menu from the Hotel La Salle. (Probably) Chicago in 1920*

**Modern Equivalent: Online Ordering Kiosk or Website's Menu**

<img src="https://www.mheducation.com/content/dam/mhe/blog/higher-ed/2025/images/introbiz/output-onlinepngtools-2024-10-08T073222.049.png" width="250" height="500"> <br>
*Image: (McDonald's) Ordering Kiosk*

**Comparison:**

**What's lost in digitization:**
- **Physical design:** The texture of menu paper, embossed lettering, original colors (scans fade/distort)
- **Size/format:** Physical menus had fold-out sections, unusual sizes that conveyed the restaurant's style
- **Complete artifact:** Stains, tears, wear patterns told stories (Ex: popular restaurants had more fingerprints)

**What's gained in digitization:**
- **Preservation:** Physical menus deteriorate quickly (cheap paper, grease, handling); digital copies don't
- **Access:** Physical menus require in-person visit; digital version accessible worldwide
- **Ease in Updating:** Easy to alter dishes or add new menu items
- **Data analysis:** Can computationally analyze dish frequency, pricing trends—impossible with physical menus alone

#### Example 3: Broadcast TV Cooking Shows -> Online/Streamed Cooking Videos or Shows

**Historical Object: Broadcast Cooking/Recipe Shows**

<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aU8BhMYpJaQ/maxresdefault.jpg" width="500" height="250"> <br>
*Image: Julia Child on The French Chef, PBS broadcast (source: YouTube archival upload)*

**Modern Equivalent: Online Streamed Cooking/Recipe Shows**

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmM3MmUwYzEtYzIyMy00ZWFiLWFlMWUtZGNkNWRjN2ZlNzQ4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg" width="250" height="500"> <br>
*Image: MasterChef (American TV series) season 15*

**Comparison:**

**What's lost in digitization:**
- **Broadcast experience:** Watching at a scheduled time, as a communal event (everyone watched together)
- **Appointment viewing:** The ritual of tuning in at 7pm created different engagement than on-demand

**What's gained in digitization:**
- **On-demand access:** Watch anytime, pause, rewind, rewatch—impossible with broadcast TV
- **Global reach:** Web-streamed videos reach billions; PBS was regional/national
- **Direct interaction:** Comments allow viewers to ask questions, share results; TV was one-way

<summary><strong><b>Rana Bouchama</b></strong> — Born-digital materials</summary>

### Our Relevant Materials
____

**Plenty of born-digital materials:** online cookbooks, cooking videos (YouTube, TikTok, etc), cooking websites etc etc.

**Comparison to digitized materials:** less convenient. 
  - If I’m looking for a recipe online, chances are I’m not going to go for a pdf of a cookbook but rather to a cooking website (or an online cookbook)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><b>Rana Bouchama</b></strong> — Oldest Digital Library/Archive</summary>

### Oldest Digital Archive
___

**One of the oldest digital libraries I could find:** [The Food Timeline](https://www.foodtimeline.org/)
- Created in 1999, the most recent update is August 2024!!
- Began as a series of books before becoming digitized (also somehow born digital? Because text was turned into a website)
- Done via HTML
- Lynne Oliver died in 2015, upkeep done by family members before donated to Virginia Tech

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><b>Cynthia Shen</b></strong> — Newest Digital Library/Archive</summary>

### Newest Digital Library/Archive
___
  
  - **Newest:** `Google Arts & Culture`, founded in 2011, but is more focused when food are served as visual culture/art topics in a curated way, there’s also reports of food stories in modern time including like astronaut food, but overall really lack of those historical materials and digitizing print of food, so it’s more like a curated cultural platform.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><b>Michelle Yi</b></strong> — Viral Examples</summary>

### Viral Examples
___
  - There is no shortage of viral examples of our digital object, from *rainbow bagels* to *Dubai chocolate*.
  - These spread rapidly through social media, as people share related content, and they gain widespread attention and mainstream popularity.
  - A food going viral often leads to the food becoming heavily commodified. For instance, Dubai chocolate is now being mass-produced by companies and brands for profit, which centers corporate   profit over the cultures and people that originated the food.
  - Another example of how a food trend can impact the food is the gentrification of trending foods like ube, where prices are raised, and it is marketed towards affluent consumers, making it     less affordable for the Filipino communities it originally came from.

<summary><strong><b>Soham Solanki</b></strong> — Free vs. Proprietary Access</summary>

**Free:**

- **Internet Archive (archive.org)**: Fully open, searchable, crawlable. Wayback Machine captures food blogs, recipe sites, and early food media. Also has cookbooks, food magazines, historical culinary texts. However, it doesn’t systematically collect social media food content, captures are opportunistic rather than curated for food culture research
- **Library of Congress Web Archives - Food Culture Collection**: free, but selective. Curated collections of food blogs, culinary websites, some social media preservation. However, it misses the vernacular, everyday food content where most cultural “negotiation” happens.
- **University food repositories**: examples include NYU’s Food Studies collection and Boston University’s Gastronomy archives. Free for academic use, and it really only has a physical/historical focus, not much social media content

**Commercial (or proprietary)**:
- CrowdTangle (Meta, no longer): was restricted to approved researchers, journalists, non profits. It tracked lots of content, including viral food content, across Facebook and Instagram.
- Brandwatch/Sprout Social/Hootsuite: expensive subscriptions, designed for marketing. It captured social media food trends, hashtag analysis, and user engagement. It was mainly commercial analytics tools, not preservation. The data disappears when subscription ends, which ties in to Besser’s nightmare of "leased" vs. "owned" access.
- TikTok Creative Center and Research API: limited researcher access, constantly changing the terms and conditions of access. Gives direct access to TikTok food content, the main platform for food culture. However, the platform controls what can be studied, for how long, under what terms - referred to as a “walled garden”.
