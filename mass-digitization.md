## Questions
1) What search strategies did you use?
- started by searching for the poem titles in HathiTrust
- Advanced Search: Author and Title of the Magazine, filter by Year after, then looked in the Hennessey dataset to find the magazine it was published in
- Searched for poem title in magazine
- **How we figured it out: USE THE Quotes from the Poem with “”**
2) Were you able to find all the issues you looked for?
- Yes, we were.
3) What barriers or challenges did you encounter?
- Searching for the poem titles didn’t surface relevant/accurate results
- Poems were inside magazines, advanced search by title and author did not give us results we needed

**Examining OCR Quality**

4) Can you search for specific words or phrases within the document?
- For **Prayer Bells**, we were able to search for words and find them within the document pretty seamlessly, except for text that was too small to be read and too small to be searched.
- For **June** and **A Song to the Flowers**, the issue was digitized pretty well, and we were able to search for specific words/phrases.
5) How accurate is the OCR text compared to what you see in the page images?
- From preliminary searching, it seems that **Prayer Bells’** text tended to be small and unreadable as well as the margins being lop-sided
- **June’s** scan was high-quality and OCR was able to read it perfectly.
- **A Song to the Flowers’** OCR text is accurate to what is visible in the page images
6) What kinds of errors do you notice? (Consider fonts, layouts, damaged pages, etc.)
- For **Prayer-Bells** (The Colored American magazine) and **A Song to the Flowers**: The page margins aren’t consistent from page to page.
- For **June**, the page margins are consistent, but some pages of the issue were too washed out and damaged, making it hard for the reader or an OCR software
7) How might OCR quality affect research using this material?
- Better OCR quality leads to a more seamless search for material, if you can’t tell what you are reading, and if the computer is unable to recognize the text within the document and match it to your search then it makes the research process much more difficult.

**Understanding Context**

8) What additional context do you gain from seeing the original page?
- We get to see the FULL poem; the dataset only has excerpts of them.
9) What else appears on the page or in the issue alongside the poem?
- Before the poem **Prayer Bells** there is a short article about and uplifting famous Black men of the time. After the poem, there was what seems to be a chapter of a novel from another site.
- In **June**, there’s another poem on top of it, called “June Lyrics”, and a header showing the issue, date, and volume.
10) What information was lost in creating just the dataset of poems?
- Visual layout of the page (font size, spacing, column structure)
- Surrounding content such as ads
- Material texture
11) What information was gained by creating the structured dataset?
- Standardized and more searchable

## Group Theme: Food as Cultural Artifacts 🍽️
## Discovering and Digitizing Cultural Objects

<details>
<summary><strong><b>Soham Solanki</b></strong> — Digital Representation</summary>
Some digital objects/representations that would be valuable for studying food as cultural artifacts are:
- TikTok recipe videos (with full metadata): the video itself, with captions, hashtags, likes, comments, and engagement metrics would capture not just the food but the performance, cultural framing, and community response.
- “Food Discourse” tweet threads: there are many debates surrounding the authenticity of different foods (e.g. “Is this authentic pad thai?” or “You can’t call that jollof rice.”). These threads can talk about cultural ownership and authority in real-time
- Food prep content: videos where food preparation is hand-in-hand with lifestyle performance (e.g. “get ready with me” or “easy 5-ingredient recipes if you’re in a rush”), showing how food signals discipline, morality, or identity.
