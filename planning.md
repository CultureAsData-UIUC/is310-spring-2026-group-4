<summary><strong><b>Cynthia Shen</b></strong> — Representation of single-serving meals in TikTok cooking videos</summary>

- **Project Focus**

    This project aims to explore how **single-serving meals** are presented and circulated in short-form cooking videos on social media, using TikTok as a case study. Situated within a broader focus on food culture, the project examines both the types of foods that appear in single-serving content and the ways these meals are     framed through narratives of convenience, creator presentation, and short-video formats.
  
- **Potential topics of interest**
  
  - Patterns in the types of foods most commonly associated with single-serving cooking (e.g., recurring dish categories or “quick meal” formats)
  - How short-form video conventions influence which kinds of single-serving meals are produced, promoted, and made popular
  - The relationship between food types, creator presentation and visibility (e.g., identity cues, anonymity, setting) and Video traffic and dissemination
    
- **Dataset contents**

  The dataset will include approximately 50–100 manually selected TikTok videos featuring single-serving meals. For each item, the dataset will record structured information including:
  
  - **Food and preparation**
    - Dish type (e.g., rice/noodles, salads, sandwich, soup, pizza)
    - Degree of preparation (fully homemade, semi-prepared, or pre-made)
      
  - **Narratives of convenience**
    - Whether convenience or ease is emphasized (explicitly, implicitly, or not at all)
  - **Creator presentation**
    - Whether the creator appears on screen and/or claims a recognizable identity (e.g., student, office worker, fitness-oriented creator), or remains anonymous and task-focused; Cooking context or setting (e.g., dorm room, small apartment, workplace, late-night setting)
      
  - **Video form**
    - Video length
    - Presence of recurring title formats or series indicators (e.g., “day X,” episodic cooking)
      
  - **Platform language and impact**
    Hashtags used
    Available engagement metrics (e.g., likes, saves, comments), when visible
  
- **Dataset creation approach**
  
  - **Data sourcing**
    - The dataset will be created from scratch through manual collection of publicly accessible TikTok videos
    - Videos will be identified using keyword searches related to single-serving and quick cooking (e.g., “single serving,” “cooking for one,” “quick meal,” “easy dinner”), along with manually discovered relevant hashtags
      
  - **Selection criteria**
    - Included videos must depict the preparation of a meal intended for one person and show some aspect of the cooking process
    - Included videos hsa to had a relatively high impact (criteria of high impact should be defined further)
      
  - **Manual annotation**
    - Each selected video will be manually reviewed and annotated for contents listed in the section above
      
- **Automated Process (TBD)**
