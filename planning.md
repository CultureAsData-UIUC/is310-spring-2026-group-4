# First Submission: Collective & Individual Topic Selection

## Group Theme: Food as Cultural Artifacts 🍽️
We are interested in how food functions as a cultural artifact in contemporary digital and media spaces. We explore food beyond its ingredients, but as a medium through which identity, values, performance, health, and cultural meaning are constructed and contested within contemporary online platforms.

**OUR DATASETS PLAN to CAPTURES:**
	•	Digital representations of food
	•	Short-form video content (e.g., TikTok)
	•	Captions, hashtags, comments, and engagement metrics
	•	Cultural narratives around food, such as:
	•	Authenticity vs. adaptation (e.g., “real” vs. “Americanized” cuisines)
	•	Health, optimization, and productivity framing (e.g., protein-focused diets)
	•	Convenience, single-serving meals, and individualized eating
	•	“Ethnic” vs. “Western” cuisine categorization and visibility
	•	Food as identity and performance
	•	Food used to signal lifestyle, morality, discipline, tradition, or trendiness
	•	Cultural ownership, hybridity, and transformation across contexts
	•	Platform-mediated food culture
	•	Algorithmic amplification of certain cuisines or aesthetics
	•	Trends, challenges, and viral food formats

These areas directly support our individual dataset ideas, which analyze how food circulates as a cultural object rather than a purely material one.

## Collaboration Plan
We have made a **Messages** group chat, and that will be our main form of communication. We plan to organize the GitHub by individual contributions, adding group assignments as seperate files as necessary.

<summary><strong><b>Cynthia Shen</b></strong> — Representation of Single-serving Meals in TikTok</summary>

- **Project Focus**

    This project aims to explore how **single-serving meals** are presented and circulated in short-form cooking videos on social media, using TikTok as a case study. Situated within a broader focus on food culture, the project examines both the types of foods that appear in single-serving content and the ways these meals are     framed through narratives of convenience, creator presentation, and short-video formats.
  
- **Potential topics of interest**
  
  - Patterns in the types of foods most commonly associated with single-serving cooking (e.g., recurring dish categories or “quick meal” formats)
  - How short-form video conventions influence which kinds of single-serving meals are produced, promoted, and made popular
  - The relationship between food types, creator presentation and visibility (e.g., identity cues, anonymity, setting) and Video traffic and dissemination
    
- **Dataset contents**

  The dataset will include approximately 50–100 manually selected TikTok videos featuring single-serving meals. For each item, the dataset will record structured information including:
  
  - **Food and preparation**
    - Dish type (e.g., rice/noodles, salads, sandwich, soup, pizza)
    - Degree of preparation (fully homemade, semi-prepared, or pre-made)
      
  - **Narratives of convenience**
    - Whether convenience or ease is emphasized (explicitly, implicitly, or not at all)
  - **Creator presentation**
    - Whether the creator appears on screen and/or claims a recognizable identity (e.g., student, office worker, fitness-oriented creator), or remains anonymous and task-focused; Cooking context or setting (e.g., dorm room, small apartment, workplace, late-night setting)
      
  - **Video form**
    - Video length
    - Presence of recurring title formats or series indicators (e.g., “day X,” episodic cooking)
      
  - **Platform language and impact**
    Hashtags used
    Available engagement metrics (e.g., likes, saves, comments), when visible
  
- **Dataset creation approach**
  
  - **Data sourcing**
    - The dataset will be created from scratch through manual collection of publicly accessible TikTok videos
    - Videos will be identified using keyword searches related to single-serving and quick cooking (e.g., “single serving,” “cooking for one,” “quick meal,” “easy dinner”), along with manually discovered relevant hashtags
      
  - **Selection criteria**
    - Included videos must depict the preparation of a meal intended for one person and show some aspect of the cooking process
    - Included videos hsa to had a relatively high impact (criteria of high impact should be defined further)
      
  - **Manual annotation**
    - Each selected video will be manually reviewed and annotated for contents listed in the section above
      
- **Automated Process (TBD)**

<summary><strong><b>Soham Solanki</b></strong> — "Protein in Everything": Healthy Eating, Optimization, and Food as Cultural Performance on Social Media</summary>

## Project Focus
This project examines how “healthy habits” are constructed, performed, and circulated on social media through the growing trend of adding protein to everyday foods. It being within the broader theme of food as a cultural artifact, the project explores how protein-focused food content frames health not merely as physical well-being, but as a visible marker of discipline, productivity, and self-optimization. By analyzing short-form social media content, this project investigates how protein becomes a symbolic ingredient, used to moralize food choices, aestheticize routines, and signal participation in contemporary wellness and fitness cultures.

## Potential Topics of Interest
- How protein is framed as a “good,” “clean,” or morally superior nutrient
- Differences in how protein is incorporated into meals, snacks, desserts, and beverages
- Language used to associate protein with discipline, productivity, and self-improvement
- Visual and aesthetic patterns in protein-focused food content (gym-adjacent imagery, minimalist kitchens, routine formats)

## Example Content Under Consideration
#### Protein-Enhanced Everyday Foods
- Protein coffee or protein matcha
- High-protein cereals, pancakes, or oatmeal
- Protein desserts framed as “guilt-free” alternatives
#### Routine & Habit Content
- “What I eat in a day (high-protein)” videos
- “Easy” meal prep content emphasizing macros and efficiency
- Morning or post-workout food routines
#### Wellness & Fitness-Oriented Framing
- Food presented as “fuel” or “investment”
- Protein intake linked to productivity or mental clarity
- Overlap between gym culture and food aesthetics
#### Cultural Pushback & Humor
- Satirical or ironic takes on protein overload
- Comment sections questioning necessity or balance
- Creators resisting or recontextualizing the trend

## Dataset Contents
The dataset will consist of publicly available social media posts that explicitly frame protein consumption as part of healthy habits or wellness routines. For each post, the dataset will record information across the following categories:

#### Post Metadata
- Platform (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts)
- Date posted
- Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares)
#### Media & Text
- Video or image (or archived link)
- Caption text and hashtags
- On-screen text emphasizing protein or health claims
#### Creator Context (when publicly stated)
- Self-positioning (fitness-focused, lifestyle, casual home cooking)
- Framing of expertise (personal experience vs instructional authority)

## Dataset Creation Approach
#### Data Sourcing
- Public posts will be collected manually from sources such as TikTok and Instagram
- Initial discovery through hashtags such as #highprotein, #healthyhabits, #proteinrecipes, #wellnessroutine
- Posts will be archived via links and screenshots rather than downloaded media
#### Selection Criteria
Posts must meet at least two of the following criteria:
- Explicit mention of protein in captions, text overlays, or audio
- Framing of food as part of a “healthy” or “productive” habit
- Routine-based or repeatable content format

Excluded content:
- Pure supplement advertisements
- Medical or clinical nutrition advice
- Brand-only influencer partnerships without narrative framing
#### Manual Annotation & Coding
Each post will be manually annotated, mainly looking at:
- Health Framing (optimization, balance, restriction, humor)
- Protein Function (enhancement, replacement, justification)
- Narrative Tone (aspirational, instructional, ironic)
- Cultural Context (fitness culture, wellness lifestyle, productivity norms)

<summary><strong><b>Flynn Huynh</b></strong> — Pizza, Chinese Takeout, etc. - Authentic or Not? Culinary Transformations in U.S vs International Cuisine</summary>

#### Project Focus

This project aims to explore how immigrant-origin dishes are transformed, documented, and discussed when adapted to American contexts. Situated within a broader focus on food culture of our group theme, the project examines culinary transformations across multiple immigrant communities—including Chinese-American, Italian-American, Mexican-American, and potentially Indian-American or Jewish-American cuisines—to identify patterns in how these dishes are represented, and how "authenticity" is constructed in contemporary digital spaces.

#### Potential topics of interest (will be minimized)

* How different types of transformations (pure American inventions vs. adaptations) are narrated differently across food and recipe sources, and community discussions
* Patterns in ingredient substitutions across immigrant cuisines and what these reveal about American preferences, ingredient availability, and cultural adaptation
* The creator background (community member vs. mainstream food writer vs. corporate source) of these dishes among different recipes
* How "authenticity" is claimed, contested, or dismissed differently across immigrant communities

#### Example dishes under consideration

Some example dishes that this project will examine:<br>
**(NOTE: These examples are based on my personal food knowledge and will need further research):**

**Chinese-American:**
* **Orange Chicken** - Type: Pure American invention - Origin claim: Panda Express, though contested - Key transformation: Does not exist in China; created for American palates - Ingredients: Orange juice concentrate, sweet sauce, American-style breading
* **Fortune Cookie** - Type: Misattribution (actually Japanese-American) - Origin: Japanese tea gardens, San Francisco (1900s-1910s?) - Key transformation: Became synonymous with "Chinese restaurants" post-WWII 

**Italian-American:**
* **Chicken Parmesan** - Type: American invention inspired by Italian techniques - Origin: Italian-American communities - Key transformation: Chicken not traditional in Italian "parmigiana" (eggplant is) - Substitutions: Mozzarella abundance, meat-heavy American preferences
* **Spaghetti and Meatballs** - Type: Adaptation (meatballs exist in Italy, but not with spaghetti) - Origin: Italian-American communities (1880s+) - Key transformation: Meat became affordable in US; dishes combined, portions increased

**Mexican-American:**
* **Mission-Style Burrito** - Type: American invention (San Francisco) - Origin: Mission District taquerías - Key transformation: Size (massive), rice inside (not traditional Mexican), foil-wrapped - Cultural note: "Chipotle model" of customization
* **Nachos** - Type: Border invention (Tex-Mex) - Origin: Ignacio "Nacho" Anaya, Piedras Negras, Mexico (1940s) for American customers - Key transformation: Created specifically for American tourists; stadium nachos barely resemble original

**Additional communities under consideration:**
* **Indian-American:** Chicken Tikka Masala (UK→US transformation), American-style Naan (garlic naan as default, used for pizza/tacos)
* **Jewish-American:** New York-Style Bagel (larger, softer than Eastern European originals), Pastrami on Rye (Romanian -> NYC deli culture)

Final dish selection (8-12 dishes total each with 5-8 different recipes / sources) will be determined based on data availability and to ensure representation across transformation types and immigrant communities.

#### Dataset contents

The dataset will include documentation of approximately 8-12 transformed dishes across 3-4 immigrant communities. For each dish, the dataset will record information from three source types:

* **Recipe documentation (contemporary, 2020-2026)**
   * Recipe source type (community-created food blog, mainstream recipe aggregator, YouTube channel, corporate site)
   * Author background (when identifiable: community member, non-community food writer, corporate/anonymous)
   * Ingredients listed and notable substitutions from "traditional" versions
   * Cooking techniques and equipment
   * How origin story is told (if mentioned)

* **Food media**
   * TasteAtlas
   * Michelin Guide
   * Eater
   * etc.

* **Community discussions (public social media)**
   * Platform (Reddit, YouTube comments, food blog comments)
   * Commenter self-identified background (when stated)
   * Discussion themes (authenticity debates, ingredient debates, personal/family memories, dismissal of authenticity concerns) (**IF ENOUGH TIME ONLY**)

#### Dataset creation approach

* **Data sourcing**
   * The dataset will be created through a combination of web scraping (for recipes and structured data) and manual content analysis (for narratives and qualitative themes)
   * Recipe sources will include community-specific food blogs (Ex: The Woks of Life, Chicano Eats, The Nosher), mainstream recipe aggregators (AllRecipes, NYT Cooking, Food Network), and YouTube cooking channels
   * Food media sources will include magazine articles (Bon Appétit, Eater, Saveur), books on immigrant food history (Ex: "The Fortune Cookie Chronicles," "Taco USA"), and food documentaries

* **Selection criteria**
   * Dishes must have clear immigrant-community origins AND documented transformation/adaptation in American contexts
   * Dishes should represent a range of transformation types: pure American inventions (Orange Chicken, Mission burrito), significant adaptations (Spaghetti & Meatballs, Chicken Parm), and misattributions (Fortune Cookie)
   * Sources must be contemporary (2020-2026) to capture current documentation practices and narratives
   * For community discussions, only public posts will be included; private groups and personal communications excluded

* **Manual annotation & coding**
   * Each recipe source will be manually reviewed and coded for ingredients, techniques, framing, and author background
   * Food media sources will be qualitatively analyzed for credibility, whose voices are centered, and how transformation is explained
   * Community discussions will be thematically coded for authenticity debates, sentiment, and language patterns

#### Connection to responsible data practices (For me to keep in mind while working)

Here is how my idea resonates with several principles from "Responsible Datasets in Context":

* **Tell the data's story:** The dataset will explicitly document the dishes themselves, from its origin to its transformation in the US.

* **Acknowledge what's missing:** Early immigrant restaurant documentation is often non-existent (working-class establishments didn't formally document recipes; oral traditions weren't written down). The dataset will explicitly discuss these gaps and treat absence as meaningful data—what does it tell us that certain communities or dish origins are poorly documented?

* **Consider data labor:** Immigrant communities created these dishes, often without credit or compensation. Contemporary recipe bloggers, food writers, and corporations may profit from documenting or adapting these foods. The analysis will consider who benefits from this cultural knowledge and whether original creators are credited.

* **Touch every data point:** Rather than relying on pre-existing datasets (like Kaggle), this project involves manual review of each source to understand context, assess credibility, and identify patterns in how stories are told. (**NOTE: This could lead to a small dataset, thus each dishes will have multiple recipes to counteract that**)

* **Privacy and ethics:** Only publicly shared recipes and posts will be used; usernames will be anonymized; family recipes not intended for public sharing will be excluded.
